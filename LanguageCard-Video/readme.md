# Anki Note Type: Language Card - Video

Show video with subtitle on Anki cards.

**It's only supported on AnkiDroid!**

## Fields

1.  Video Title (Sort by this field in browser)
2.  Video File Name
3.  Poster File Name
4.  Target Subtitle Content
5.  Native Subtitle Content
6.  Notes

## Why don't I use the default media player?

Because of subtitles an statistics.

If I use this syntax in my Anki cards: `[sound:video_file_name.webm]`, it's works fine! But there aren't subtitles and the learning time will be false in my statistics.

## Anki file size limit (during synchronization on AnkiWeb)

"At the moment there are [no limits on the size of your media](https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/are-there-limits-on-file-sizes-on-ankiweb), although the size of individual media files is limited to 100MB."

I use video files largen than 100MB, so Anki has to synchronize only note type with subtitles.
